    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `myOBE.config()`\n",
    "  Configures the settings and parameters arrays and constands based on the `sets`, `params` and `cons` variables.  These variables must set up before running `config.`\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `myOBE.pdf_update(onesetting, ymeas, sigma)`\n",
    "  Recieves new measurement data, `ymeas` $\\pm$ `sigma`, and updates the probability distribution function using Bayesian inference.  The model function is evaluated once for each possible combination of parameters.\n",
    "  - `onesetting` a tuple representing the combination of settings used in the measurement. \n",
    "  - `ymeas` a float, the measurement value.  Interpreted by the code as the mean of a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "  - `sigma` a one-standard-deviation estimate of the uncertainty.  Interpreted by the code as the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `myOBE.opt_setting()`\n",
    "  Computes a utility function $U(x)$ for each possible combination of settings $x$. $U(x)$ is an estimate of how much \"good\" a measurement at settings $x$ will do in terms of refining the parameter distribution.  See the manual for details.  The calculation of $U(x)$ is the most computationally demanding part of a measurement cycle; For `myOBE.Ndraws` random parameter values, the model function is evaluated at every possible combination of settings.\n",
    "  - `return:` a tuple containing measurment settings that correspond to the maximum $\\max[U(x)]$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `myOBE.good_setting(pickiness=1)`\n",
    "  Computes the utility function $U(x)$ as in `myOBE.optsetting()` and selects a setting $x$ with a probability proportional to $U(x)^n$ where the exponent $n$ is given by the `pickiness` parameter.\n",
    "  - `pickiness` a value that skews the setting selection away from small $U(x)$ and toward large values.\n",
    "  - `return:` a tuple containing good - but maybe not the optimal - measurement settings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `myOBE.besty()`\n",
    "  Provides something like the best-fit curve.  Using parameters from the maximum of the parameter probability distribution, the model fuction is evaluated for every experimental setting.\n",
    "  - `return:` a numpy array with the dimensions of parameter space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In addition to these methods, the OptBayesExpt class also inherits all the methods and data from the ExptModel and ProbDistFunc classes.  For example `myOBE.get_PDF()` (a ProbDistFunc method) will work just fine."
