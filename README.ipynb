    "## What is it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository offers an implementation of optimized Bayesian experimental\n",
    "design (OBED). It is for cases where we have confidence in a\n",
    "mathematical model of a system, and we merely want to determine\n",
    "parameters of the model. Least-squares fitting is the usual approach in\n",
    "this situation. Examples include linear models with slope and intercept\n",
    "parameters, peaks with positions, heights, and widths, and also\n",
    "oscillations with amplitudes and frequencies. The real benefit of OBED\n",
    "methods is that they direct measurements toward settings that have the\n",
    "best chance of making our parameter estimates more precise. This feature\n",
    "is very heplful in situations where the measurements are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Bayesian optimization is 'something completely different' that\n",
    "has proven to be useful for machine learning. Typically, those are\n",
    "situations where the system isn't well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does it do?\n",
    "Using a common measurement strategy, we might measure $y_i$ for a series\n",
    "of $x_i$ values and then, when the data's all collected, do least-squares\n",
    "fit that determines parameters for a model function. Or maybe\n",
    "we look at the data and decide to run the measurements again, only with\n",
    "$x_j$ values more focused on some region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian Optimized Experimental Design plays the role of the\n",
    "experimenter who looks at the data and decides to change the measurement\n",
    "settings in order to get better, more meaningful data. Note the two\n",
    "steps here. The first step, looking at the data, is really an act of\n",
    "extracting meaning from the numbers, learning something about the system\n",
    "from the existing measurements. The second step is using that knowledge\n",
    "to decide what to do next. But instead of waiting for the measurements\n",
    "to finish, the OBED algorithms evaluate the data constantly and make\n",
    "measurement setting decisions \"on the fly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian optimized experimental design, our knowledge of the system\n",
    "parameters is represented by a joint probability distribution function.\n",
    "The learning step is performed using Bayesian inference to refine this\n",
    "distribution for each measurement value. Narrow distributions correspond\n",
    "to precisely measured parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision step uses the model function and the the parameter\n",
    "distribution to suggest settings for the next measurement. This step\n",
    "looks at fluctuations in the model's predicted measurement values when\n",
    "the parameters are drawn randomly from their probability distribution. A\n",
    "good choice for the next measurement will \"pin down\" fluctuations where\n",
    "they are large, so we choose settings where the model predicts large\n",
    "fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important step is left to the user, however. As delivered,\n",
    "the BayesOptExpt is ignorant of the world, and it's the user's\n",
    "responsibility to describe the world in terms of a model, reasonable\n",
    "parameters and reasonable experimental settings. As with any computer\n",
    "program, \"the garbage in, garbage out\" rule applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's included?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core files\n",
    " \n",
    "The package incorporates a few Python classes that provide the basic\n",
    "fuctionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ProbDistFunc_class.py** implements the probability distribution\n",
    "  function. Its methods are used to define the parameters and their\n",
    "  respective ranges, perform basic mathematical functions, to supply\n",
    "  random draws, basic statistics of the distribution, and the\n",
    "  distribution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ExptModel_class.py** provides methods to define the experimental\n",
    "  settings and to evaluate a model function. The model function itself\n",
    "  must be provided by the user, preferably by adding it to an instance\n",
    "  of the BayesOptExpt class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OptBayesExpt.py** provides methods for the learning and deciding steps\n",
    "  described above. This class inherits all methods and data from both\n",
    "  ProbDistFunc and ExptModel, and it is the only class that a user will\n",
    "  need to interact with directly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Just one so far. More would be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sequentialLorentzian.py** is an example script that demonstrates how to\n",
    "  incorporate a simple model of a Lorentzian peak into a BayesOptExpt. A\n",
    "  simulation takes the place of a real measurement, supplying noisy\n",
    "  \"measurement results\" that the BayesOptExpt uses to locate and focus\n",
    "  on a randomly placed peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add-ons\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra code for extra functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OBETCP.py** provides way to use optimized Bayesian experimental design\n",
    "  software with programs written in other languages. OBETCP incorporates\n",
    "  an OptBayesExpt class with a server that communicates with external\n",
    "  programs via TCP socket connections. Configuration commands,\n",
    "  measurement settings and measurement data are sent as json-ified\n",
    "  strings over the TCP sockets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **LabView/OBE_ODMR_demo.vi** demonstrates how OBETCP.py can be used from\n",
    "  Labview. Like the sequentialLorentzian.py example, it's about finding\n",
    "  and measuring a Lorentzian peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docs/sequentialLorentzian.html** and \n",
    "* **Docs/sequentialLorentzian.ipynb** provide a gentle introduction to the OptBayesExpt software in `html` and jupyter notebook `ipynb` formats.  They include explanations of the setup and use of `OptBayesExpt` in an example simulated \"measurement\" of a Lorentzian peak.  The `ipynb` file is live code that can be run from inside the jupyter notebook environment. Both formats are derived from **sequentialLorentzian.py**.\n",
